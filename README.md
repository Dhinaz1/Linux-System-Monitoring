Project Overview
The objective is to build a Linux System Monitoring Tool that continuously monitors critical system metrics and provides real-time insights into the health and performance of a Linux server. The tool will display information on CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, network activity, and running processes. It may also include features like alerts, logging, and report generation.
